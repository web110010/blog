> Note: This is my personal opinion

I have been a regular user of the delhi metro, one of the best metro systems in the world. Over the past decade as I have travelled more and more in it I have noticed quite a few things, like the `1.25km` long interchange at `Dhaula Kuan`, like what were you thinking dmrc, every one of your planners should walk that path daily, to remind them of hell they have created.

# Getting back on track

Being a regular metro commuter, I have travelled through both elevated and underground stations. Travelling elevated is much more pleasent, simply because I have something to look at out of the window, it much better than looking at concrete as you travel from station to station.


Another important factor that I personally really like is the feeling of power when you get off at the station and look out below at the peasents in their cars stuck in traffic. The feeling of having the high ground is amazing, who told them stupid people to choose the worse way to travel.

Being underground feels quite a bit congested and stuffy. Being able to see outside makes one feel much more spacious, this is quite noticble when the metro is filled to the brim.

Elevated metro is also cheaper to build than underground, which means more metro for the same money and who doesn't like more metro.
